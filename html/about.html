            <h2>Our History</h2>
            <p>
                Started by two sisters, Sere is a company
                that was built in 2021 to encourage self care
                and self love.
            </p>
            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>
                We are intent on giving people a chance
                to be at ease and let off the worries of this
                world. All our products and services are
                designed to help our clients relax and be
                comfortable.

            <h2>Our Vision</h2>
            <p>
                We envision ourselves growing to become
                the go-to store for self-care products such as
                home fragrance and body care products.
                We also will give a platform for conversations
                centered on self care and self love. This
                will create a community of like-minded
                individuals who treasure therapeautic
                products and conversations.
